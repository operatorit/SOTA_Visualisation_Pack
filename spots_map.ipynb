    "## What SOTA is?\n",
    "SOTA (Summits On The Air) is an activity designed for radio amateurs (called also HAMs) who like hiking. It is about communication via ration between an activator - operator who climbed a designated summit (map available at https://sotl.as/map) - and chasers - all other operators. Call (or QSO) may be done with the use of telegraphy (morse code), voice or data transmission on any band available for radio amateurs. To make a successfull call, both operators need to exchange report, which say how they hear each other, and log it into a log. SOTA results are then uploaded into https://www.sotadata.org.uk/en/ webpage.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you hear someone activating a summit (or want to make chasers aware the you are currently activating), you can send a spot for dedicated webpage (https://sotawatch.sota.org.uk/en/).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find all information about SOTA programme at https://www.sota.org.uk/.\n",
    "\n",
    "This script is designed for chasers who want to check which summits are currently activated. With the use of data of latest activations received via SOTA API and summits coordinates in SOTA Database file, it creates an interactive map to visualise frequency and band of each activation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For best experience, you can run this script during weekends, when there's a spike in SOTA activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also find helpful live version of this script I deployed at my webpage: https://www.operator-paramedyk.pl/sota/."
